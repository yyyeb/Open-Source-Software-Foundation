I am interested in how a split is assigned to workers.  From the [code](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/f6bd37f079de46073d0f38fe58580183e79c8222/presto-hive/src/main/java/com/facebook/presto/hive/HiveSplit.java#L199):\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Override\r\n    public List<HostAddress> getPreferredNodes(List<HostAddress> sortedCandidates)\r\n    {\r\n        if (sortedCandidates == null || sortedCandidates.isEmpty()) {\r\n            throw new PrestoException(NO_NODES_AVAILABLE, \"sortedCandidates is null or empty for HiveSplit\");\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (getNodeSelectionStrategy() == SOFT_AFFINITY) {\r\n            // Use + 1 as secondary hash for now, would always get a different position from the first hash.\r\n            int size = sortedCandidates.size();\r\n            int mod = path.hashCode() % size;\r\n            int position = mod < 0 ? mod + size : mod;\r\n            return ImmutableList.of(\r\n                    sortedCandidates.get(position),\r\n                    sortedCandidates.get((position + 1) % size));\r\n        }\r\n        return addresses;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt makes me surprise that Presto only uses the hash of the path to determine preferred nodes. If a file is large enough and can be divided into multiple splits, then the cached work will be overloaded, and hence make cache a litter bit inefficient.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/15720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/15720/timeline"},{"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto","category":{"id":6207471,"node_id":"MDE4OkRpc2N1c3Npb25DYXRlZ29yeTYyMDc0NzE=","repository_id":5349565,"emoji":":pray:","name":"Q&A","description":"Ask the community for help.

Technical debt refers to \"\"not quite right code which we postpone making it right” (Cunningham) and this may often introduce a cost. More specifically, the aim of this study is to gather information on how open source developers respond to specific source code phenomena such as partially or wrongly implemented functionality. With the results of this study we aim to create a better understanding of how developers annotate issues in source code. These results will be used to support prioritisation of maintenance activities in software systems. The survey data will be collected, analyzed and stored so that research questions can be answered and the results can be published. Since the survey is anonymous, no personal information is collected. For the same reason we cannot modify or remove answers upon request.\r\n\r\nIf you contribute code to this project you can help us out by filling out the following survey: https://forms.office.com/r/QmrtwiA296. The survey should take you at most 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nFiorella","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/16852/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/16852/timeline"},{"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto","category":{"id":6207471,"node_id":"MDE4OkRpc2N1c3Npb25DYXRlZ29yeTYyMDc0NzE=","repository_id":5349565,"emoji":":pray:","name":"Q&A","description":"Ask the community for help.

For example, we didn't want to introduce a dependency on Zookeeper, because this would increase the infrastructure requirements for anyone who wanted to use the feature.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are two recent developments that I think change the picture:\r\n\r\n1) [With Amazon S3 announcing support for conditional writes](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/08/amazon-s3-conditional-writes/), now all major cloud storage providers have the ability to provide distributed locks: GCS and Azure through compare-and-swap, and [S3 with conditional writes](https://www.morling.dev/blog/leader-election-with-s3-conditional-writes/).  For on-prem installations, Ceph supports conditional PUT, and MinIO also supports conditional writes.  So, there's an argument to be made that at this point, it's difficult to *not* find a storage platform that doesn't provide the ability to let you use conditional locks, and because distributed storage is essentially a requirement for most use cases of Presto, we could implement leader election using distributed storage.  Of course, the mechanism to establish the leader would be encapsulated behind a plugin, and potentially other mechanisms like Zookeeper or etcd could be implemented as well.\r\n2) [The `PUT` API recently introduced](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/pull/23407) could be used by the leader, established by the route above, to distribute query execution management amongst multiple coordinators.\r\n\r\nThere are still some questions to figure out, such as where to place the discovery server and whether or not we will still need a resource manager.  One thought is that the leader takes on the responsibility of the resource manager.  Or we could keep that process as is.  If the leader takes on the responsibility of the resource manager, then the discovery server would need to redirect nodes to the leader in case of a failover.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/23692/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/23692/timeline"},{"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto","category":{"id":6207469,"node_id":"MDE4OkRpc2N1c3Npb25DYXRlZ29yeTYyMDc0Njk=","repository_id":5349565,"emoji":":hash:","name":"General","description":"Chat that doesn't fit anywhere else","created_at":"2020-06-05T04:03:41.000+08:00","updated_at":"2020-06-05T04:03:41.000+08:00","slug":"general","is_answerable":true},"answer_html_url":null,"answer_chosen_at":null,"answer_chosen_by":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/orgs/prestodb/discussions/23775","id":7277714,"node_id":"D_kwDOAFGgvc4AbwyS","number":23775,"title":"Prestissimo TPCDS performance","user":{"login":"sumokiama","id":253311,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MzMxMQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/253311?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama","html_url":"https://github.com/sumokiama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/sumokiama/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","state_reason":null,"locked":false,"comments":1,"created_at":"2024-10-04T18:29:50Z","updated_at":"2024-10-07T15:01:06Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"We have setup an AWS 2xr5dn.8xlarge Prestissimo cluster and have set up the hive connector to access our S3 TPCDS datasets.

Why do I need to submit the data together.\r\nIs the coordinator implemented in this way in native presto?\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/23835/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/23835/timeline"},{"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto","category":{"id":6207472,"node_id":"MDE4OkRpc2N1c3Npb25DYXRlZ29yeTYyMDc0NzI=","repository_id":5349565,"emoji":":bulb:","name":"Ideas","description":"Share ideas for new features","created_at":"2020-06-05T04:03:41.000+08:00","updated_at":"2020-06-05T04:03:41.000+08:00","slug":"ideas","is_answerable":true},"answer_html_url":null,"answer_chosen_at":null,"answer_chosen_by":null,"html_url":"https://github.com/orgs/prestodb/discussions/23834","id":7321390,"node_id":"D_kwDOAFGgvc4Ab7cu","number":23834,"title":"Should we adopt conventional commits?","user":{"login":"tdcmeehan","id":7980573,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjc5ODA1NzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7980573?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan","html_url":"https://github.com/tdcmeehan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tdcmeehan/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","state_reason":null,"locked":false,"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-10-15T13:01:24Z","updated_at":"2024-10-15T13:01:25Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Today, we follow a few conventions which seem slightly esoteric these days:\r\n\r\n1) We follow the git commit guidelines from Chris Beams, [as documented in our contributing guide](https://github.com/prestodb/presto/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-standards).\r\n2) We add tags to the beginning of commits in an ad-hoc way (see: https://github.com/prestodb/presto/issues/21342)\r\n\r\nBoth of these have problems.  The guidelines from Chris Beams help to ensure a clean, readable commit history, but they seem difficult to automate or add validation for.  For example, it seems like it would be difficult to ensure that the subject line is in the imperative mood.  Moreover, it seems because this is all based off of a blog post instead of a real specification, any attempt to validate these commits would have to be a custom tool.  Because there is no validation, sometimes PRs are merged with commits which do not conform to our guidelines.\r\n\r\nThe tags have issues because we are inconsistently applying them (see #21342).\r\n\r\nTo recap, we like the current way of structuring commits because it ensures a clean, readable commit history, but we would prefer a little more automation and less room for error.\r\n\r\nOne idea is to use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).  Conventional commits allow us to continue to continue to preserve a readable commit history, but because [the format of the commit actually has a specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification), we can add validation on the commit message.  A quick browse shows that there's many tools that are ready to use off the shelf that support this specification, so we could quickly add validation.  \r\n\r\nI think if we were to adopt this specification, it would make the PR review easier for everyone--the PR submitter would quickly understand that their commit does not follow the specification (which is widely known and documented outside of Presto), and the PR reviewer would make less mistakes and leave less repetitive feedback.

When configuring multiple plugins, it can be a bit of a pain to see the at a glance configuration of Presto, because they're scattered across several properties.  I think it would be easier to provide a default instance of a configuration if we allow inline plugin configuration in the main config file.\r\n\r\nThe idea would be to add a special prefix for plugins, such as `plugin.`, then followed by a key indicating the plugin itself (such as `hive`), then a key indicating the instance of the plugin if applicable (such as `hive_interactive1`).  There's a bit of disorganization in how we configure plugins, and I think this would clean it up a bit.  Keys which are not prefixed by `plugin.` will continue to be strictly validated, and to prevent an accident where a core property is added which has this prefix, we can add a checkstyle rule which would fail the build if it's added at any point in the future.\r\n\r\nWe could still support the old way of configuring plugins.  I have a couple ideas\r\n1) Preferred. We could fallback to the old way if no property of the matching plugin and plugin instance are found.  Perhaps we can throw if both are present simultaneously.\r\n2) We could treat the plugin properties in `config.properties` as a default, and override when a dedicated `etc` config present.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any thoughts.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/24348/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/prestodb/presto/discussions/24348/timeline"}]
